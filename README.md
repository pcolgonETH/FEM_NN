# FEM_NN
This repository contains essential files for a project aimed at developing and implementing deep learning models to predict the constitutive behavior—linking strain and stress—in finite element (FE) simulations. These models are designed as surrogates for material models within FE solvers, enabling faster and more efficient simulations.
