# FEM_NN
This repository contains essential files for a project aimed at developing and implementing deep learning models to predict the constitutive behaviorâ€”linking strain and stressâ€”in finite element (FE) simulations. These models are designed as surrogates for material models within FE solvers, enabling faster and more efficient simulations.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **`data/`**: Raw data files generated from FE simulations. These include strain-stress datasets used for training and testing.
- **`preprocessing/`**: Scripts for preprocessing raw data, including scaling, normalization, and formatting routines.
- **`models/`**: Contains deep learning models, including:
  - Example cases for testing and experimentation.
  - Pre-trained weights for immediate use.
  - Configuration files to replicate training processes.
