# FEM_NN
This repository contains essential files for a project aimed at developing and implementing deep learning models to predict the constitutive behaviorâ€”linking strain and stressâ€”in finite element (FE) simulations. These models are designed as surrogates for material models within FE solvers, enabling faster and more efficient simulations.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **`Raw_Data/`**: Raw data files generated from FE simulations. These include strain-stress datasets used for training and testing.
- **`Pre_Processing_Files/`**: Scripts for extracting, preprocessing raw data.
- **`NN_Model_Files/`**: Contains deep learning models, including:
  - Example cases for testing and experimentation.
  - Pre-trained weights for immediate use.
- **`GUI/`**: Contains all necessaray files to execute a GUI built along this thesis for a more streamlined workflow
- **`UMAT_Files/`**: Contains User Material Subroutine files
